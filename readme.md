### Window explanation

**Important note**
For all windows with a gray background, when you press 'Escape' the window will become transparent making it look a lot better. For some windows such as 'Weather Information' or 'Battle mode' you must have it as a transparent window to have all its functionality. For some windows resizing and moving will only be possible when the are **not** transparent

**Flag Display**
Will show the current track status. It will blink yellow when a SC or a VSC is triggered and it will turn purple when a new fastest lap has been set.

**Weather Information**
It shows the track and air temperature over time and shows the current humidity and pressure. It also has the wind direction and wind speed plus if it is raining or not.

**Track Information**
Shows information about the track such as DRS being enabled, pit exit or entry being open, session timer, status of the session (whether the session is started), ect.

**Sector Statuses**
Shows the statuses of all mini sectors (segments) on track. It also shows whether the segment has a slippery surface or not.

**Delayed Track Time**
Shows the current time on track in their timezone.

**Session Log**
Shows a list of the past change of events in the session. Driver pit entry or exit, pit stop times and tire changes (race only), new fastest laps, new lap starts (race only), DRS changes, new team radio's (disabled by default), ect. A new bar will be generated if a event occurs.

**Single Race Control Message**
Show new race control messages that are coming through. It will also show icons based on their type so you can quickly see the type and importance of the message. It will be shown for a few seconds and then disapear

**Battle Mode**
Select drivers you want to see the gap between. The amount of driver you can select depents on the width of the window. It also shows telemetry and lap times per driver but that gets removed if it wouldn't fit all the selected driver.

**Current Laps**
Shows all the drivers that are on a push lap. It shows the mini sectors and the sector times. It also shows information to a 'target' driver which is picked based on the session and position. This is most useful during a practice or qualifying session. It also sorts on order of the driver on track meaning the top one will finish their lap first and so forth.

**Crash Detection**
Will show cars that have crashed or need to retire based on the car driving slow or stopping.

**Tire Stats**
Will show information about the used tires. It will show the top 3 times set using that tire, the total laps driven and sets used of that tire and it will also show the delta to the other tire compounds so you can see which on is the quickest.

**Govee Lights**
Shows how many govee lights are connected. The Govee integration is disabled by default and you will need to enable LAN Control for you lights in order for it to connect. (the lights are connected to the flag display window)

**Auto Onboard Camera switcher**
Will switch the onboards based on priority. This would be very useful if you can't open all the onboards but don't want to miss anything that is happening on track. It will take in account, pit stops, crashes, within DRS, catching and retirements to set the priority of the drivers. Then it will check how many onboards are show and it will make sure to put the (amount of opened OBC's) most important drivers on display. It will automatically be synced to the main feed meaning you don't need to do anything. (You must select your main feed in the settings for it to sync without buffering. Default is the 'international' feed)
